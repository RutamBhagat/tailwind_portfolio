      description: `The Smart-Brain application uses image URI as an input, 
      and then itâ€™ll detect all the faces in the image using Clarifai face detection API, 
      and tags them by puting boxes around their faces. 
      The front end is built using React, Tailwind and frontend was deployed on netlify, 
      backend on render and heroku was used for deploying the PostgreSQL database. 
      In backend it has its own REST API server with express. 
      It keeps a record of user login details such as usernames, hash encrypted passwords using bcrypt and
      count of how many faces they have detected so far with the app, securely in a PostgreSQL database. 
      SmartBrain V-2 is a fully responsive web site, and the react-tsparticles library make it look even cooler.`,
